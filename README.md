revolutionary new technology that turns any image into obama

# How to use

**Use the ui at the top of the window to control the animation, choose between saved transformations, and generate new ones.** You can change the source image and target image, and choose how they are cropped to a square (tip: if both the images are faces, try making the eyes overlap). You can also change these advanced settings:
| Setting               | Description                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| resolution            | How many cells the images will be divided into. Higher resolution will capture more high frequency details. |
| proximity importance  | How much the algorithm changes the original image to make it look like the target image. Increase this if you want a more subtle transformation. |
| algorithm             | The algorithm used to calculate the assignment of each pixel. Optimal will find the mathematically optimal solution, but is extremely slow for high resolutions. |
